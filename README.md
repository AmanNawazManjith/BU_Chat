# BU Chat or simply 'Back-Up' Chat

This web application works just like any group texting platform.\
Initially the user will have to sign in using your gmail account going through the authentication process.\
Now the user can text freely in the chat environment, where the use of profane words are not allowed, if suppose the user
does make an abusive entry, they would be banned for life from the group chat.
This feature has been implemented by forming our set of rules in the firebase ```rules``` section.
